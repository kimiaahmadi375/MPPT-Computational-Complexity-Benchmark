# MPPT Computational Complexity Benchmarking Resources

This repository provides algorithmic pseudocode and benchmarking resources
supporting the Scientific Reports submission:

**"Adaptive Gradient Descent–Based MPPT with Hardware-Oriented Computational Complexity Benchmarking"**

## Contents
- Pseudocode representations of 25 MPPT algorithms with reported hardware or real-time implementations
- Pseudocode of the proposed adaptive gradient descent–based P&O MPPT algorithm
- Operation-level counting rules used for computational complexity evaluation
- Normalized ASIC-weighted cost model (X metric)

## Purpose
The materials in this repository are intended to support transparent and reproducible
benchmarking of MPPT algorithms at the operation level, independent of processor
architecture or implementation platform.

## Scope and limitations
- The repository contains pseudocode and benchmarking resources only.
- Full simulation models, source code, and implementation-specific design files
  are not included.
- The provided materials are intended for academic benchmarking and reproducibility.

## Citation
If you use these materials, please cite the associated Zenodo record.
